Analyze:
- meta types: primitive, complex, collection
- type is tree where each node is one of meta types
- instance of type is tree too but with values

Future features:
- Think about inheritance (as called known types)
- Validation
- Multi dimensional arrays (quad and jagged)
- Typeless serialization (store full type name in xml) (?)
- Support of heterogeneous collections (store full type name in xml) (?)

Features:
- Built-in serialization IList, ICollection, IEnumerable, IDictionary and theirs generic analogs
- Support Xml* attributes to provide element names
- Support Data* attributes to provide element names
- Extensibility point for custom serialization of values of specified type
- Extensibility point for custom serialization of values of specified type as primitives

Notes:
- There is may be no invariance when serialize/deserialize collection with null items.
- Add extension to serialize into file.
- Add extension to serialize into Stream.
