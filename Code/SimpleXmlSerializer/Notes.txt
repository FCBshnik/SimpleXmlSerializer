Features todo:
- Add strategies to handle unknown types
- Add support for type serialization: Uri, NameValueCollection
- Think about inheritance (so called 'known types')
- Use XmlReader ReadSubTree method for custom serializers
- Add settings to ignore specified types to be serialized
- Add extensibility point via 'type adapter' (like surrogates in .net built in xml serialization)

Features:
- Serialization of primitive types: bool, byte, int, long, float, double, decimal, char, string, TimeSpan, DateTime, DateTimeOffset
- Serialization of collection types: Array, IList, ICollection, IEnumerable, IDictionary and theirs generic analogs
- Serialization of complex types (with parameterless ctor)
- Serialization of enum types
- Serialization of nullable types
- Support of Xml* attributes to provide element names (XmlRoot, XmlElement, XmlArray, XmlArrayItem, XmlAttribute, XmlIgnore)
- Support of Data* attributes to provide element names (DataContract, DataMember, DataCollection, IgnoreDataMember)
- Naming conventions (no, camel case, pascal case)
- Extensibility point for custom serialization of values of specified type
- Extensibility point for custom serialization of values of specified type as primitives

Notes:
- Add extension to serialize into file.
- Add extension to serialize into Stream.
